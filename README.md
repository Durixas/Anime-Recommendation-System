# Anime Recommendation System based on Matrix Factorization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of a recommendation system for anime enthusiasts. Leveraging PySpark, the system suggests anime likely to interest users, providing personalized recommendations through advanced collaborative filtering techniques.

## Key Highlights

- **Recommendation Model Implementation:** Implemented a recommendation model in PySpark, utilizing collaborative filtering techniques to suggest anime based on user preferences.

- **Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) with Spark SQL:** Conducted OLAP using Spark SQL to efficiently process and analyze large-scale anime datasets.

- **Matrix Factorization with ALS Model:** Trained an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) model for Matrix Factorization, enabling the system to learn latent factors and provide personalized recommendations. Developed user-based and item-based algorithms to address cold start problems.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross Validation:** Tuned model hyperparameters through cross-validation, achieving the optimal model with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.2 in a user rating range of 1-10.

**Note:** This notebook is designed to be run in Google Colab.
